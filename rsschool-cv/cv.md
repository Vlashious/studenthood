1. Well, you already know my name by now. I'm 19yo, studying at the BSUIR, sophomore. Looking for new experience and knowledge, especially in front-end. I just love how sites nowadays are modern and simple but yet gorgeous. That's why I decided to try these courses. And yes, I understand that leraning is important, especially today. If you are not learning now - you're gonna end up dead by tomorrow. Studying at the University gave me this feeling, trust me :)
1. My skills are:
    * C++ - studying it at the University rn,
    * js - love this language. I think it is a bit (just a little bit) similar to C++,
    * HTML, CSS - like js, I know it, but in a passive way. Hadn't had a good practice, yet. BUT! I want to try it ;p
1. Well, code examples. I have only C++ examples, I hope it will do :^) It converts a decimal number to binary 16 bit number with the biggest bit for the sign.
`vector<int> ToBinarySMR(int x) {
	vector<int> binNumber(SIZE, 0);
	if (x < 0) binNumber[0] = 1;
	int pos = SIZE - 1;
	do {
		if (x % 2 == 0) {
			pos--;
			x /= 2;
		}
		else {
			binNumber[pos] = 1;
			pos--;
			x /= 2;
		}
	} while (x != 0);
	return binNumber;
}`
1. My experience is mostly positive, even that I don't have any job experience. Love coding, love creating algorithms and things in my head and then translating them into code and then watching it work is just SO PLEASANT. BUT! I hate what everyone hates - debugging >:(
1. I have some completed courses on coursera.com, and as I already said, I'm studying at the BSUIR.
1. Won some olympiads at the school (1-st and 2-nd stages in 10 and 11 classes), so I have quite good level of English and vocabulary. I have some experience playing games with people speaking English, also I play only English version of games. Also some chatting in Discord with English speaking people too.
