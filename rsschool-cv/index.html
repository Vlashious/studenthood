            Well, you already know my name by now. I’m 19yo, studying at the BSUIR, sophomore. 
                Looking for new experience and knowledge, especially in front-end. I just love how sites nowadays are 
                modern and simple but yet gorgeous. That’s why I decided to try these courses. And yes, I understand 
                that leraning is important, especially today. If you are not learning now - you’re gonna end up dead 
                by tomorrow. Studying at the University gave me this feeling, trust me :) <br>
            My skills are:
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ - studying it at the University rn,</li>
                    <li>js - love this language. I think it is a bit (just a little bit) similar to C++,</li>
                    <li>HTML, CSS - like js, I know it, but in a passive way. Hadn't had a good practice, yet.
                         BUT! I want to try it ;p</li>
                </ul>
            Well, code examples. I have only C++ examples, I hope it will do :^) It converts a decimal number 
                to binary 16 bit number with the biggest bit for the sign. 
                <span class="code">
                    &lt;int&gt; ToBinarySMR(int x) { vector&lt;int&gt; binNumber(SIZE, 0); if (x &lt; 0) binNumber[0] = 1; 
                        int pos = SIZE - 1; do { if (x % 2 == 0) { pos--; x /= 2; } else { binNumber[pos] = 1; 
                            pos--; x /= 2; } } while (x != 0); return binNumber; }
                </span> <br>
            My experience is mostly positive, even though I don’t have any job experience. Love coding, 
                love creating algorithms and things in my head and then translating them into code and then watching 
                it work is just SO PLEASANT. BUT! I hate what everyone hates - debugging >:( <br>
            I have completed some courses on coursera.com, and as I already said, I’m studying at the BSUIR.
            Won some olympiads at the school (1-st and 2-nd stages in 10 and 11 classes), so I have quite good level 
                of English and vocabulary. I have some experience playing games with people speaking English, also I play 
                only English version of games. Also some chatting in Discord with English speaking people too.
